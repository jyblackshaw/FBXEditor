# FBXEditor
A Unity Editor tool for non-destructively modifying imported FBX models. It provides tools to combine/separate static and skinned meshes, bake transforms to fix orientation, edit pivots, and auto-link textures. The final edited model can be saved as a new FBX file or overwrite the original asset.

Please see the following links, they delve much deeper into how the asset works.

# Development
The FBXEditor was born from my own frustrations during game development. I frequently encountered issues with third-party models that required modification, but the standard workflow—"round-tripping" a model by exporting it to a 3D program and re-importing—is notoriously time-consuming and error-prone. The FBXEditor was created to solve this, allowing developers to perform complex edits directly inside Unity, free from the normal editor's constraints. This tool was developed over a two-month period. Note, no code is included here because that would defeat the purpose of selling it for money.

# Revenue
Since Launch 10/15/25 The FBXEditor has generated 1800$+ of revenue.
