# FBXEditor
A Unity Editor tool for non-destructively modifying imported FBX models. It provides tools to combine/separate static and skinned meshes, bake transforms to fix orientation, edit pivots, and auto-link textures. The final edited model can be saved as a new FBX file or overwrite the original asset.
